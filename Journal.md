** DAY 1 Learning HTML and CSS **

- Entry 1:
  Today I started learning HTML and CSS from scratch.
  I know how to use HTML tags like paragraph, header, anchor/link, lists (ordered/unordered), navigation, main, div, image, tables, forms.
  I know what is CSS. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets and it is used t ostyle a webpage.
  CSS use selectors (element/id/class/attribute) to target HTML elements and style them.
  Common CSS properties are margin, padding, width, height, border, font-family/style/size/weight, text color, background color, etc.
  We connect the CSS to the HTML by using a link tag in our head tag.

- Entry 2:
  I did a challenge where I had to build a simple Frequently Asked Page webpage using HTML and CSS. Although I couldn't make the design exactly as shown (only 25% match) I learnt how to position elements and change some of their behaviour.
  I will come back to this challenge to finish it.
